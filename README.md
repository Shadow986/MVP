# MVP

PROJECT NAME: ROYAL FOOTWEAR
TAGLINE: 

Team Members

Ben Vilakazi - Frontend Development 
Marcia Maphosa - Backend Development 
Archford Chipadza - Middleware

These roles were decided so that each of us would get an opportunity to work on our weak areas to strengthen them and push us out of our comfort zones.

Technologies
To complete our project, we've considered the following technologies:

Frameworks:  Next.js (frontend), Django (backend)
Authentication: Django Authentication System
API: Django Rest Framework 
Admin: Django Admin Panel
Database: MySQL 
Hardware: Adequate server resources (for deployment and testing)
Books/Resources:
"You Don't Know JS" (for JavaScript learning), "Two Scoops of Django" (for best practices in Django)
Stackoverflow
Documentation
Medium.com

Technology Choices:

1. Frontend Framework: 

Next.js vs. React.js

Next.js was chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities, which improve SEO and performance. It also offers file-based routing and built-in CSS support.

React.js  is a popular alternative that provides more flexibility and a larger ecosystem. However, it requires additional configuration for server-side rendering and routing. 

The decision for Next.js was driven by the need for a more out-of-the-box solution with less setup required for SEO optimization and routing.




2. Backend Frameworks:

Django vs. FastAPI

Django was selected for its robustness, scalability, and the rich set of features it offers, including an ORM, admin panel, and authentication modules, Django REST Framework is an extension of Django that makes building APIs easier. It's a great option if the project is API-heavy.

FastAPI is an emerging alternative known for its speed and asynchronous support. However, it has a smaller community and less built-in functionality compared to Django.

The choice of Django was influenced by the comprehensive features it provides out of the box, reducing the need for additional packages and simplifying development.

These decisions were made to balance development speed, performance, and the long-term maintainability of the project.

Databases

When choosing between MySQL and PostgreSQL for an e-commerce website database with Django, there are several factors to consider:

PostgreSQL is often recommended by the Django community and is known for its robustness, feature set, and compliance with SQL standards. It supports advanced data types and has powerful indexing capabilities, which can be beneficial for complex queries and data analytics. PostgreSQL also offers significant advantages in terms of concurrency, reliability, and architectural flexibility

MySQL, on the other hand, is known for its simplicity and speed. It’s a widely-used database that’s considered reliable and easy to set up. MySQL might be a good choice if you’re looking for a database with a gentle learning curve and broad community support. However, it may lack some of the advanced features and strict compliance with SQL standards that PostgreSQL offers







Choosing MySQL for an e-commerce website database with Django can be justified for several reasons:
Simplicity and Speed: MySQL is renowned for its ease of use and fast performance, which can be advantageous for e-commerce sites that prioritize quick transaction processing and straightforward database management1.
Widespread Adoption: As one of the most popular databases in the world, MySQL has a large community and extensive resources available. This can be helpful for troubleshooting and finding solutions to common problems1.
Mature Ecosystem: MySQL has been around for a long time, which means it has a mature ecosystem with a wide array of tools and integrations that can simplify database operations for an e-commerce site1.
Compatibility and Support: MySQL is well-supported by Django, and there are numerous plugins and extensions available that can help to optimize the performance of your e-commerce site1.
Cost-Effectiveness: MySQL can be more cost-effective, especially for small to medium-sized e-commerce platforms, due to its open-source nature and the availability of affordable hosting options1.
Ease of Scaling: While PostgreSQL is also scalable, MySQL is often perceived as easier to scale horizontally, which can be beneficial for growing e-commerce sites expecting a surge in traffic.


It’s important to note that while MySQL has many benefits, PostgreSQL may still be preferred for applications requiring advanced features, such as complex transactions or concurrency control. The choice ultimately depends on the specific requirements and goals of your e-commerce project.

Challenge statement

ROYAL FOOTWEAR is designed to address the problem of access to high-quality, durable, and comfortable footwear at an affordable price. Many consumers often find themselves purchasing low-quality shoes due to budget constraints, which wear out quickly and require frequent replacement. This not only leads to increased expenditure over time but also compromises on comfort and foot health.

Our company aims to disrupt this cycle by offering top-tier brands like Nike, Adidas, and Timberland at significantly reduced prices. We achieve this by sourcing these high-quality shoes at lower costs, thereby making them accessible to a wider audience.

The benefits are twofold: Firstly, customers can now afford to wear premium shoes that offer superior comfort and durability. Secondly, the longevity of these shoes means customers won’t need to replace their footwear as frequently, leading to long-term savings.

In essence, our project is committed to making quality footwear affordable, promoting both financial savings and foot health for our customers.

Variety of Brands: While we focus on providing high-quality brands like Nike, Adidas, and Timberland, we may not cover all shoe brands in the market. Customers looking for less common or niche brands may not find them in our portfolio.
Availability of Sizes: Our company aims to cater to a wide range of customers, but there may be limitations in the availability of certain sizes, especially for very small or very large shoe sizes.
Global Shipping: Depending on the scope of the project, we may not be able to deliver shoes globally. Customers outside of our shipping areas may not benefit from our services.
Immediate Availability: As we source high-quality shoes at lower costs, there might be a waiting period for certain popular models or sizes due to high demand.
Custom Designs: Our Company does not offer custom-designed shoes. Customers seeking personalized designs or unique color combinations may need to look elsewhere.

Remember, the goal of the Portfolio Project is to make quality footwear more affordable and accessible, but it may not cater to every individual’s specific needs or preferences.

Budget-Conscious Consumers: Individuals who are looking for high-quality footwear but are constrained by their budget will greatly benefit from our project. They can now afford top-tier brands without compromising on quality or comfort.

Fashion Enthusiasts: Those who value style and brand names will find our project appealing. We offer popular brands like Nike, Adidas, and Timberland, allowing fashion enthusiasts to keep up with the latest trends without breaking the bank.


Long-Term Savers: People who understand the value of investing in durable goods will appreciate our project. By offering shoes that last longer, we help customers save money in the long run.
Health-Conscious Individuals: Customers who understand the importance of proper footwear for overall foot health and comfort will find our project beneficial. High-quality shoes can provide better support and comfort, reducing the risk of foot-related health issues.

Our users are individuals who value quality, comfort, style, and affordability when it comes to their footwear choices. Whether they’re fashion-forward individuals, budget-conscious consumers, or health-focused customers, our project aims to meet their footwear needs effectively and affordably.

ROYAL FOOTWEAR, being an online store, is not strictly dependent on a specific locale. It is designed to cater to a global audience, given its capability to deliver abroad. This means that people from different parts of the world can access and benefit from our services, as long as international shipping is available to their location.

However, there may be some locale-specific considerations such as:

Shipping Costs and Times: These may vary depending on the customer’s location. Customers in more remote areas may face higher shipping costs or longer delivery times.
Import Duties and Taxes: Depending on the country, customers may be subject to additional import duties and taxes which are not included in the initial price.
Product Availability: While we strive to offer a wide range of products, availability may vary depending on the region due to different distribution agreements with the brands.

In essence, while our project is accessible globally, the user experience and costs may vary depending on the customer’s location.

Infrastructure
Branching and Merging:

Our team uses the GitHub Flow strategy for branching and merging. This involves:

Creating a new branch for each feature or bug fix from the `main` branch.
Naming branches with descriptive names related to the feature or fix.
Submitting a pull request (PR) for code reviews once the work is completed.
Ensuring that automated tests pass before merging.
Merging smaller, frequent updates to `main` after team review to keep the integration process smooth and manageable.

Deployment Strategy:

We employ an automated deployment strategy using a CI/CD pipeline. The steps include:

Automated testing and building of the application upon each commit to the repository.
Deployment to a staging environment for further testing and client review.
Upon approval, automated deployment to the production environment.
Rollback capabilities in case of any issues post-deployment.

Data Population:

To populate the app with data, we will:

Use Django management commands to load initial data sets.
Implement data migration scripts for transferring data from existing systems if necessary.
Develop a custom admin interface for non-technical team members to input and manage data.

Testing Tools and Processes:

Our testing suite includes:
Jest for frontend unit and integration tests in the Next.js application.
Django's test framework for backend testing, including model, view, and API tests.
Selenium or Cypress for end-to-end testing.
Integration of testing tools into the CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically on every push to the repository.
Regular code reviews and pair programming sessions to ensure quality and knowledge sharing.

This approach ensures a robust, secure, and scalable web infrastructure for our full-stack e-commerce website, with a focus on automation, best practices, and a smooth workflow for the development team.
